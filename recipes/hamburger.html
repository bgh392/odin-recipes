         <h3>Ingredients and Cookware</h3>
            <p>When cooking it is important to have <em>mise en place</em> (all things in their place). Unless otherwise noted you should have all of your ingredients and cookware readily available and measured to the recipe's specifications before you begin the cooking process.</p>

                        <li>Garlic powder (1 teaspoon)</li>
                        <li>Ground black pepper (1/2 teaspoon)</li>
                        <li>Sliced cheese (Your choice, 4 slices)</li>
                        <li>Hamburger buns (4)</li>
                        <li>Preferred condiments and toppings</li>
                    </ul>
                <h4>Cookware</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Grill</li>
                        <li>Spatula for flipping burgers</li>
                        <li>Mixing bowl</li>
                    </ul>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
                <p>Follow these steps for quick and easy hamburgers.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Step 1</li>
                                <p>Preheat the grill to 375 degrees F (medium-high).</p>
                            <li>Step 2</li>
                                <p>In a large bowl, add the beef. Sprinkle evenly with the Worcestershire sauce, seasoning salt, garlic powder, and pepper. Use your hands to mix the ingredients until they are just combined.</p>
                            <li>Step 3</li>
                                <p>Divide the meat mixture into fourths. Take 1/4 of the meat mixture and use your hands to press it into the shape of a hamburger patty that is about 3/4 inch thick. Make an indention in the middle of the patty to prevent bulging in the center of the hamburger as it cooks. Repeat with the remaining meat mixture, making 4 hamburgers.</p>
                            <li>Step 4</li>
                                <p>Place the burgers on the grill. Cook 4-5 minutes on the first side. Flip the burgers over and cook an additional 4-5 minutes, until the burgers have reached the desired doneness.*</p>
                            <li>Step 5</li>
                                <p>If adding cheese, lay a slice of cheese on each burger patty about 1 minute before taking the burgers off the grill, so the cheese has a chance to melt.</p>
                            <li>Step 6</li>
                                <p>Serve the burgers on hamburger buns with optional hamburger toppings.</p>
