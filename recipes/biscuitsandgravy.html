        <h2>How to make Biscuits and Gravy.</h2>
            <p>Biscuits and gravy are one of the most essential breakfast meals.  With this recipe you'll be making your own biscuis and gravy in no time.</p>
            <p>In this article I will first explain all the ingredients and tools necessary to cook the dish and then give a detailed step-by-step process for making biscuits and gravy.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients and Cookware</h3>
            <p>When cooking it is important to have <em>mise en place</em> (all things in their place). Unless otherwise noted you should have all of your ingredients and cookware readily available and measured to the recipe's specifications before you begin the cooking process.</p>
            <h4>Ingredients.</h4>
                <p>Biscuits</P>

                    <li>Milk (1 cup)</li>
            </ul>
                    <p>Gravy</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ground beef (85/15, 1Lb)</li>
                <li>Garlic powder (2 teaspoon)</li>
                <li>Onion powder (2 teaspoons)</li>
                <li>Rubbed sage (1 teaspoon)</li>
                <li>Salt (1 teaspoon)</li>
                <li>Pepper (1/2 teaspoon, or to taste)</li>
                <li>Flour (1/3 cup)</li>
                <li>Milk (4 cups)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Cookware</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Oven</li>
                    <li>Large mixing bowl</li>
                    <li>Skillet</li>
                    <li>Baking Sheet</li>
                </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Step 1</li>
                                <p>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. </p>
                            <li>Step 2</li>
                                <p>Put the ground beef to a mixing bowl. Sprinkle the garlic powder, onion powder, sage, salt, and pepper over the ground beef. Mix it together until thoroughly combined, and voila, now you have ground beef sausage. Cover the sausage and set it aside in the refrigerator while you mix up your biscuits.</p>
                            <li>Step 3</li>
                                <p>Add the flour, baking powder, sugar, cream of tartar, and salt to a large mixing bowl and whisk together. Cut in the butter. Add the egg, pour in the milk, and stir together until the dough is combined.</p>
                            <li>Step 4</li>
                                <p>At this point, if you like your biscuits a little more on the rustic side, you can flour your hands and form the dough into balls. But if you like flaky layered biscuits, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, roll out to about 1/2″ thickness, fold the dough over, and roll out to a 1/2″ thickness. Repeat the process, dusting the counter with flour as needed, 6 (ish) times, using a biscuit cutter or a glass turned upside down to cut out your biscuits.</p>
                            <li>Step 5</li>
                                <p> Place your biscuits (balls or cutouts) on a lightly greased baking sheet. Put them in the oven and bake for 10-15 minutes or until lightly golden brown. Take them outta the oven and let them cool for just a bit while you finish up your gravy.</p>
                            <li>Step 6</li>
                                <p>Once your biscuits are in the oven, take the sausage out of the fridge and cook it in a large skillet (I use my big daddy 12″ skillet) over medium high heat for about 8-10 minutes or until browned. Do not drain the sausage – you need the fat.</p>
                            <li>Step 7</li>
                                <p>Add in the flour, cook and stir until the ground beef is evenly coated. Pour the milk into the skillet stirring constantly until the gravy begins to thicken up and simmer for 3-5 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste and keep warm until serving.</p>
                            <li>Step 8</li>
                                <p>Cut a biscuit or two in half, place them on a plate, pour a good spoonful (or two) of gravy over top, and enjoy!</p>
